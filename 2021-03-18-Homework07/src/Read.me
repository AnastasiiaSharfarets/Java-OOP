Create class MyString, that will contain one field
-
an array of characters.
The constructor of the class must accept a String,
and the constructor's task will be to initialize the
character array with the characters of this String.
Make the class
iterable and implement 2 iterators that
1. will iterate over our array in ascending order
2. will iterate over our array in descending order.
Create an Application Class with main() and test Iterators.
